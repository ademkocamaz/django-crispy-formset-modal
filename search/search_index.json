What could be the problem?</p> <p>A: Ensure that you've correctly added <code>'crispy_formset_modal'</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting. Also, make sure you've added the Django Crispy Formset Modal's JavaScript file in your template and properly included <code>jQuery</code>.</p> <p>Q: I'm trying to use a different template pack, but the formset still uses the default styles. What could be wrong?</p> <p>A: Check that you've set the <code>CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK</code> setting in your Django settings to your desired template pack. Also, ensure that you've included the respective CSS and JS files for your selected template pack in your template.</p> <p>Q: I've set the modal_size and modal_placement options, but the modal does not change its size or placement. What could be the issue?</p> <p>A: Check that you're using the <code>ModalSize</code> and <code>ModalPlacement</code> classes from the <code>crispy_formset_modal</code> package to set these options. Also, ensure that the options are set in the <code>ModalEditFormsetLayout</code> object and not elsewhere.</p> <p>Q: I've overridden the default templates, but the formset still uses the original templates. What should I do?</p> <p>A: Make sure you've created your custom templates in the correct location. For example, if you're using the Bootstrap 4 template pack and want to override the modal template, your custom template should be in a directory named <code>crispy_formset_modal/bootstrap4/modal.html</code> in your project's templates directory.</p> <p>In the event that you encounter an <code>issue</code> not covered here, please raise an issue on the Django Crispy Formset Modal's GitHub page.
