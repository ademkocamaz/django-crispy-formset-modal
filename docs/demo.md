# Live Demo and Example App

The best way to get started and understand how Django Crispy Formset Modal works is by exploring a working example. You can find a complete [demo application](https://github.com/blasferna/django-crispy-formset-modal/tree/main/demo) in the project's repository. This application showcases a typical usage scenario of the package and can serve as a good starting point for your own applications.

To run the demo application locally, clone the project's repository and follow the instructions provided in the [README.md](https://github.com/blasferna/django-crispy-formset-modal/blob/main/README.md) file. This will help you understand how the package integrates with a Django project and how to use it in your own forms.

Additionally, we have a live demo available online. The live demo allows you to interact with a Django application that uses Django Crispy Formset Modal, without the need to set up a local development environment. You can add, edit, and delete formset instances using a modal dialog, and see how the data is displayed and managed.

You can access the live demo at [https://django-crispy-formset-modal.fly.dev](https://django-crispy-formset-modal.fly.dev).

Exploring the live demo and demo application should give you a solid understanding of Django Crispy Formset Modal's capabilities. In the next section, we will provide a guide to contributing to the Django Crispy Formset Modal project.
